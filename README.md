# OpenAI Eval Tracker

With the significant improvements that come with GPT-4, there is massive demand for access to the API. There is a waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api), but there's no guarantee of when access will be granted. OpenAI has provided a way to get earlier access, however, through contributions to its recently open-sourced Evals repo (see [this note](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api#:~:text=During%20the%20gradual,Access%20Program.) and [this article](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/with-evals-openai-hopes-to-crowdsource-ai-model-testing/)). The standards are vague, noting that access will be granted to "exceptional model evaluations." A little more information can be found [in the PR template](https://github.com/openai/evals/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Looking at the active PRs and which ones have been accepted, there seems to be little feedback on the quality of a submission, and the ones that are accepted appear to be the ones that the models perform poorly on and the moderators deem "interesting" or "clever" (see [this comment](https://github.com/openai/evals/pull/302#pullrequestreview-1349533532), [this comment](https://github.com/openai/evals/pull/112#pullrequestreview-1344881565), or [this comment](https://github.com/openai/evals/pull/239#pullrequestreview-1344890191)). Some PRs sit for days while others are approved almost immediately.

To help people that are looking for inspiration for good Evals, I decided to create this repo that tracks all of the Evals that have been accepted by OpenAI. I will update twice a day, at around 14:00 GMT and 02:00 GMT.
